To create a translation of this plugin create a .mo file from the included .po file using some utility, such as poedit, and then place the generated .mo file in this directory with a filename of "utvg-[LOCALE].mo" replaceing [LOCALE] with the locale you are translating to.

If anyone has a .mo file translation they would like included in future releases of the plugin you can send the relevant files to dustin@codeclouds.net
